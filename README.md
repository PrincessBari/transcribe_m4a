# transcribe_m4a

This is a python file I created that uses OpenAI's Whisper to transcribe the audio from an m4a file. I use this to transcribe interviews when I'm working on journalism projects. The final output is a docx file. The name of the original m4a file is printed at the beginning of the document as well as timestamps every 20 seconds throughout the transcript.
